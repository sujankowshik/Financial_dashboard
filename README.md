### 🪝 Git Hooks with Husky

This project uses **Husky** for Git hooks to maintain code quality automatically:

**What is Husky?**
Husky is a tool that makes Git hooks easy. It runs scripts before certain Git actions (like commit or push) to ensure code quality.

**Pre-commit Hook** (`.husky/pre-commit`):

- ✅ Automatically runs ESLint on staged files
- ✅ Automatically formats code with Prettier
- ✅ Prevents commits if there are linting errors
- ✅ Ensures consistent code style across the team

**Benefits:**

- No more "fix lint errors" commits
- Consistent formatting across all developers
- Faster CI/CD pipelines (fewer failed builds)
- Higher code quality in the repository

The hook configuration uses `lint-staged` to only check files you're actually committing.

## 📋 Data Format (CSV & Excel)

Your CSV or Excel file should follow this format:

```csv
Date,Time,Accounts,Category,Subcategory,Note,INR,Income/Expense
01/01/2024,10:30:00,Bank Account,Food,Groceries,Weekly shopping,2500,Expense
01/01/2024,14:15:00,Savings Account,Salary,Basic Salary,Monthly salary,50000,Income
```

**Supported File Types:**

  Average = Total / Count
```

_Location:_ `src/lib/calculations/aggregations/category.js`

#### 28. **Monthly Trends**

```
For each month:
  Income = Sum of income transactions in month
  Expense = Sum of expense transactions in month
  Net = Income - Expense
  Growth Rate = ((Current Month - Previous Month) / Previous Month) × 100
```

### Running Balance

#### 29. **Cumulative Balance**

```
For each transaction (chronologically):
  Running Balance = Previous Balance + Transaction Amount
  (where Income/Transfer-In adds, Expense/Transfer-Out subtracts)
```

## 📊 Calculation Module Structure

All calculations are organized in a clean, modular structure:

```
src/lib/calculations/
├── index.js                    # Main exports
├── aggregations/
│   ├── averages.js            # Daily, monthly, per-transaction averages
│   ├── category.js            # Category grouping and top categories
│   └── totals.js              # Total income and expense
├── financial/
│   ├── cashback.js            # All cashback calculations
│   ├── reimbursement.js       # Reimbursement calculations
│   ├── savings.js             # Savings and savings rate
│   └── index.js               # Investment, tax, food, transport
├── time/
│   └── dateRange.js           # Date range and period calculations
└── legacy.js                  # Legacy calculations (for compatibility)
```

### Using Calculations in Your Code

```javascript
// Import what you need
import {
  calculateTotalIncome,
  calculateTotalExpense,
  calculateSavingsRate,
  calculateTotalCashbackEarned,
  calculateCashbackShared,
  calculateActualCashback,
  calculateTotalReimbursements,
} from "src/lib/calculations";

// Use in components
const totalIncome = calculateTotalIncome(transactions);
const totalExpense = calculateTotalExpense(transactions);
const savingsRate = calculateSavingsRate(totalIncome, totalExpense);

// Cashback metrics
const cashbackEarned = calculateTotalCashbackEarned(transactions);
const cashbackShared = calculateCashbackShared(transactions);
const actualCashback = calculateActualCashback(transactions);

// Reimbursements
const reimbursements = calculateTotalReimbursements(transactions);
```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Single source of truth - no duplicate logic
- ✅ Easy to test and maintain
- ✅ Consistent calculations across all pages
- ✅ Well-documented with JSDoc comments
- ✅ Type-safe with PropTypes validation

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### CSV/Excel Upload Not Working

- Ensure file follows the exact format specified
- Check that all required columns are present
- Verify date format is DD/MM/YYYY
- For Excel files, ensure data is in the first worksheet

#### Charts Not Displaying

- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly
- Verify file data is properly formatted

#### Build Failures

- Run `pnpm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
- Check Node.js version compatibility (>=20.0.0 required)
- Clear pnpm cache: `pnpm store prune`
